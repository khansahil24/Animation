# Animation
This program use the canvas function of the tkinter module of python 
With the help of geometry calculation and loop fuction is move continously
to bounce back the ball we just simpliy define the border of canvas and loop them as their is also a fuction called coords which track the movement and give the coordinate 
As it reach the border simplify change the directors by adding values to coordinates and as it is in loop is goes infinite
